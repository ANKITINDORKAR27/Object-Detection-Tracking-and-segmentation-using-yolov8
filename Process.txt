yolov8-cpu detection process
First of all you have to install anaconda prompt and then you need to create the environment with name yolov8-cpu-env
after that 

1 - activate environment using anaconda prompt and the command will be
>>activate yolov8-cpu-env
2 - install ultralytics using 
>>pip install ultralytics
3 - navigate to the root folder in anaconda prompt
download the pre trained model of yolo form repository
although you will get the whole complete file in my google drive link also only thing you have to create the environment in anaconda 
https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics?tab=readme-ov-file


4 - then run the command in anaconda prompt like this, every time if you open the anaconda prompt you have to activate the environment using command
>>>>activate yolov8-cpu-env
5 - once the environment is activated it will look like this..
This is the example in my system
(yolov8-cpu-env) C:\Users\Ankit>

#after that navigate the root folder where you have downloaded my google drive file
6 - copy the path and paste it in prompt like this in your case path will be depend on your system path below is the example of my system
>>>>(yolov8-cpu-env) C:\Users\Ankit>cd.. C:\YOLOV8\yolov8-cpu

7 - Then use this command for Detecting the object

(yolov8-cpu-env) C:\YOLOV8\yolov8-cpu>yolo detect predict model=yolov8l.pt source= "inferences/bus.jpg" save=True show=True line_width=1

8 - this will take time after running the command and then in the bottom it will show you the path of the output

9 - then go the folder and check the predicted file 

10 -You will find the output there 

Congratulation you have successfully done the detection and tracking using yolov8 ultralytics

If you have any doubt in executing the above command drop a mail to my mail id
